The main purpose of this project is to develop aFace Recognition Based Automated Student Attendance System.  We will be building a system that willbe  able  to  detect  and  recognize  frontal  faces  of  students  in  classroom,  and  then mark their respective attendance.  The system is exclusively designed for marking attendance in various educational institutes like in colleges and schools.  The aim ofthis project is to eliminate the traditional system ofManual Attendance Systemwhich is usually a time consuming process with chances of human error and replaceit with aAutomated Attendance System.
